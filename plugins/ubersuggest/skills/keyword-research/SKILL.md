description: >
  Run a full keyword research pass for a topic, niche, product or business and
  return a prioritised keyword list grouped into clusters. Use when the user
  asks to find keywords, do keyword research, discover what people search for,
  check search volume or difficulty for a topic, or find long-tail or
  low-competition keywords.

# Keyword research

Topic: `$ARGUMENTS` (if empty, ask what topic and market before calling anything).

## Steps

1. **Resolve the market.** If the user named a country, city or region, call
   `location_suggest` and use the returned `locId`. If they named nothing, ask
   once — or state the default you are using (US / `en`) so the numbers are not
   silently for the wrong market.

2. **Pick 1–3 seed terms** from the topic. Broad head terms, not sentences:
   "running shoes", not "where can I buy good running shoes online".
   `google_suggestions` fans out ~60 autocomplete queries *per seed*, so more
   seeds is not better.

3. **Expand.**
   - `google_suggestions` with the seeds → what people actually type, including
     questions and modifiers. Great for intent, has no metrics.
   - `keyword_suggestions` with the seeds → related terms with metrics.
   - `match_keywords` with the strongest seed → the deep paginated list. Sort
     by volume and pull one or two pages; this is the bulk of the candidates.

4. **Get metrics for the shortlist.** Cut the pool to ~20–40 candidates that
   are genuinely relevant to the user's business, then use `keyword_overview`
   on the ones that matter most (volume, CPC, SD, PD). Do not run it over
   hundreds of terms.

5. **Classify intent** for each keyword — informational / commercial /
   transactional / navigational. Infer from the query shape; when it is
   genuinely ambiguous and the keyword matters, `serp_analysis` shows what
   Google thinks the intent is by what it ranks.

6. **Cluster.** Group keywords that one page could satisfy (same intent, same
   results). Name each cluster after the page you would build.

7. **Optionally project traffic.** For the top handful, `estimate_serp_clicks`
   turns volume + a target position into expected clicks — much more persuasive
   than raw volume.

## Deliverable

A prioritised table, highest opportunity first:

| Keyword | Volume | SD | CPC | Intent | Cluster |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

Then, in prose:

- **Quick wins** — decent volume, SD under ~30, clear commercial intent.
- **Clusters worth building**, each with its suggested page type and the 3–8
  keywords it would target.
- **What to skip and why** — high SD with no authority to back it, or volume
  with no business relevance.

Sort by opportunity (volume × intent value ÷ difficulty), not by volume alone.
State the market and language the numbers are for.

Say the ranking rule out loud before the table — one line: these are ranked on
search volume weighted by how commercial the intent is and divided by how hard
the keyword is to rank for, not on volume. Then give the top ten a reason each,
one clause naming the number that put it there ("1,900 searches at SD 24 — the
only transactional term on the list a new site can realistically take"). A
top-ten with no reasoning reads as a list the user has to trust blindly, and
the reasoning is the part they cannot get from the app's export.

## When something fails

- Quota error → stop calling, deliver whatever was already gathered, and say
  which quota ran out plus what a paid plan would have let you finish, with
  https://app.neilpatel.com/en/pricing. Don't leave "wait until tomorrow" as
  the only way forward.
- `location_suggest` returns nothing → tell the user the location was not
  recognised and ask for a bigger one (country or major city).
- Empty expansion → the seed is probably too narrow or brand-specific. Try one
  broader seed rather than repeating the same call.
