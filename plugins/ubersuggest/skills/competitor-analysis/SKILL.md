description: >
  Analyse a domain and its organic competitors, then report the keyword and
  content gaps. Use when the user asks who their competitors are, why a
  competitor outranks them, what keywords a competitor ranks for, which pages
  drive a competitor's traffic, how their domain compares to another, or asks
  for a domain overview or traffic estimate for any site.

# Competitor analysis

Target: `$ARGUMENTS` (if empty, ask for the user's domain).

## Steps

1. **Resolve market and domain.** `location_suggest` if a market was named;
   `validate_site` if the input looks malformed or you are unsure it is a real
   domain. Use the bare domain (`example.com`), not a full URL with a path,
   unless you are deliberately analysing one page.

2. **Baseline the target.** `domain_overview` → organic traffic, keyword count,
   domain authority, backlink summary. This is the yardstick everything else is
   compared against. Optionally `domain_top_countries` if the user's market is
   unclear or the site looks international.

3. **Find the competitors.** `competitors` if the user did not name any. This
   is **async**: it polls for ~40s and may come back with `pendingData: true`.
   Retry a few times, cap at ~10 polls, then report it is still processing. If
   the user named competitors, pass them in the `competitors` param and skip
   the discovery.

4. **Baseline each competitor.** `domain_overview` on the top 3 — more than
   that burns daily reports for diminishing insight. Ask before going wider.

5. **Pull the keyword sets.** `domain_keywords` for the target and each
   competitor, sorted by volume/position. Enough rows to compare meaningfully
   (start around 100 per domain).

6. **Find the gaps.** Compare the sets:
   - **Keyword gaps** — keywords a competitor ranks well for (top 10) and the
     target does not rank for at all. Rank these by volume × relevance.
   - **Near misses** — keywords where the target ranks 4–20 and a competitor
     ranks top 3. These are the cheapest wins in the whole report.
   - **Strengths to defend** — where the target already beats the competitors.

7. **Find the content that works.** `domain_top_pages` for each competitor →
   which URLs actually carry their organic traffic. This reveals content
   formats and topics worth matching. `page_overview` on a standout page if the
   user wants to know why one specific page wins.

8. **Check the authority gap.** `backlinks_overview` for the target and the
   competitors. If a competitor's referring-domain count is an order of
   magnitude higher, say so — it reframes which keywords are realistic and
   whether the answer is content or links.

## Deliverable

1. **Comparison table** — one row per domain:

| Domain | Est. organic traffic | Organic keywords | DA | Referring domains |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

2. **Keyword gaps** — table of keyword, volume, SD, competitor's position,
   target's position (or "not ranking"), highest opportunity first.
3. **Near misses** — called out separately and first in the recommendations,
   because they are the quick wins.
4. **Content gaps** — the competitor topics/formats with no equivalent on the
   target site.
5. **Verdict** — in two or three sentences: is the target losing on content, on
   authority, or on technical/intent match? Then the prioritised next actions.

Never present a raw diff of two keyword lists. The value is the ranking and the
reasoning.

## When something fails

- `competitors` still pending after the poll cap → deliver the analysis with
  user-named or manually chosen competitors, and say the automatic discovery
  did not finish.
- Quota error → report which quota, stop, deliver partial results.
- Tools not connected, or `auth_status` says logged out → ask for the connection (*No numbers without the connection* in `seo-foundations`) and stop. Do not fill the gap with a web search, a page fetch or prior knowledge, and do not send the user to run the report in the web app.
- Domain returns near-zero data → likely a very new or tiny site, or the wrong
  market's `locId`. Check the market before concluding the site has no traffic.
